# AWS Glue Crawler Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to create an AWS Glue Crawler for an S3 bucket. The crawler will automatically discover the schema of the data stored in your S3 bucket and populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account
2. S3 Bucket with data
3. IAM Role with necessary permissions

## Steps

### 1. Create a Glue Crawler

1. Go to the AWS Glue Console.
2. In the sidebar, click on **Crawlers**, then click **Add crawler**.
3. Enter a name for your crawler and click **Next**.
4. Select **S3** as the data store and specify the path to your S3 bucket, e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/path/`.
5. Choose **Create an IAM role** and select the role.
6. Configure the crawler's output, select the database where you want the table to be created, or create a new database.
7. Configure any additional settings and click **Next**.
8. Review your settings and click **Finish**.

### 2. Run the Crawler

1. Go to the **Crawlers** section in the AWS Glue Console.
2. Select the crawler you just created and click **Run crawler**.

### 3. Verify the Schema

1. Once the crawler has completed, go to the **Tables** section in the AWS Glue Console.
2. You should see the tables created by the crawler, representing the data schema of your S3 bucket.
3. You can now use the Athena queries.
